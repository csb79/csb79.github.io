            <p>Hello! My name is Catherine Seidel, and I'm a graduate student who is learning about digitla media and web development 
                in additon to my grad work. Below you'll find information on my education background and experience with coding and editing digital media.
                My hope is for this site to eventually function as a portfolio that demonstrates my accoplishments.
            </p>
            <h3>Education and Experience</h3>
            <p>I completed my Bachelor's at the University of Missouri - Columbia, and I am currently working on a Masters in Educational Technology with a focus
                in being an online educator at the same institution. My professional goals are to either design/conduct online training in the corporate sector, aid teachers
                in moving their courses online, or teach in my undergrad. While working on my graduate studies, I am simultaneously learning about coding websites and
                creating digital media. I have taken courses on the material as well as studied individually on sites 
                such as <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a> learning primarily html and css.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to web development, I have mostly only created simple pages, with this site being the first proper website that I've coded by hand from scratch.
                I have a little more experience with digital media, particularly editing digital
                images. I have worked with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> a bit and recently begun using 
                <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Photoshop CC</a> - the images on the Digital Media page were created in photoshop.
                I have some experience using <a href="https://www.ocenaudio.com/" target="_blank">Ocenaudio</a> and <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank">
                Audacity</a> to record and edit audio files, and I've used Aimersoft video editor to edit simple video projects. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge and portfolio.
