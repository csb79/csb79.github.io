            <h3>Images</h3>
            <p>All of the images below were created using Photoshop CC. From left to right, the images are a parenting banner, an icon based on the parenting banner, and a beach photo.
                The parenting banner utilized two separate photos, one for the background and one in the foreground, with the foreground image being edite with a mask used to reveal the background and
                apply a fade. The the beach photo was created using a picture of a beach for the background and a picture of my family inside. Multiple techniques were necessary to reach the finished result,
                including masks for hide or reveal backgrounds and painting with light, and the creation of a repeated pattern using a selection of the beach photo. Click on each thumbnail to see 
                the fullsize
                image.

            <h3>Audio</h3>
            <p>The audio file below was created using <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/download/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>, <a href="https://www.ocenaudio.com/" target="_blank">Ocenaudio</a>, 
            and a Logitech headset. I recorded myself reading the story in Ocenaudio, and then imported that file into Audacity, where I could combine the voice track with a piece of music.
            I also applied a fade in and out, adjusted the volume of the musice, and applied an effect to the voice track. The story that was read is a 
            short <a href="https://www.creepypasta.com/in-the-kitchen/" target="_blank">Creepypasta</a>, and the music is "Omen" compossed by Ryan Amon for the Bloodborne soundtrack.

            <h3>Video</h3>
            <p>For the video proeject, I recorded the video on my Samsung Galaxy S5 and edited the footage 
                in <a href="https://aimersoft-video-editor.en.softonic.com/" target="_blank">Aimersoft video editor</a>. While editing the video, I applied a fade in/out, several transistions, and
            muted the video audio so it wouldn't clash with the background music. I also used Aimersoft's intro/credits feature to apply a title screen and end credits. The music track used in 
            the video is Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World". Click the file to auto download the mp4 file, which can be viewed using several media players 
            including <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14209/get-windows-media-player" target="_blank">Windows Media Player</a>.</p>
