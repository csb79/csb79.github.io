    <div class="center">
         <p> This isn't the first webpage I've ever coded from scratch, but it's been a while, and I definitely need the refresher! 
             The purpose of this particular page is to explore and list the two possible topics of my final webpage. The topics are very different - 
             one is based on necessity and the other on a personal interest.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="padding">
        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Personal Portfolio</h3></li>
            <li><h3>Tarantual Care</h3></li>  
        </ol>
        <h2>Reasoning</h2>
        <h4>Personal Portfolio</h4>
        <p>The most practical of my two ideas is to create a website that will function as a portfolio. The site would house my digital media creations,
            and I could include it on my resume for potential employers.
        </p>
        <h4>Tarantual Care</h4>
        <p> There really is not much need for a site on care for pet tarantula's, because there are quite a few out there, but as a keeper, the topic
            is of great interest to me. A lot of new tarantula owners are uninformed (as they make the impulsive decision to buy an exotic pet without 
            researching) and this can cause serious harm to the tarantula. As <a href="https://jamiestarantulas.com/tips/">Jamie's Tarantulas</a> states:</p>
            <blockquote>
                    <i>Many, many tarantulas have been discarded, by uneducated owners when they are on their backs, about to molt.</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>So, the more information out there to help new owners, the better.
