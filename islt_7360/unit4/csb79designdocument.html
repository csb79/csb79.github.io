    <h1>Catherine's Design Document</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of my final website is to function as a portfolio for both potential employers and/or clients. 
        People would visit my website to gain information about me, view my work (the website itself), 
        any completed projects, and they could get in contact with me. Potential employers would gain 
        information about who I am as a person, my work ethic, an idea of my skill level, and how to contact me.</p>
    <h2>Design Concept and Audience</h2>
    <p>My target audience would be either a company seeking to employ someone who could perform web or digital media 
        design or any adult who was in need of web design - this would include small business owners wanting to set up 
        a website but don’t have the skill to do it themselves, or people with websites who want digital media designed 
        for them. Companies hiring online educators or someone to design their online training. </p>
    <h3>Needs Assessment</h3>
    <p>I sent interview questions to a small group of people who have worked in management positions and were in charge of hiring
        as well as people who have found skilled workers to hire via the internet.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As an employer seeking to higher either a web designer or a digital/online content designer, 
            what would you be expecting to see on their portfolio page?</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>List of services, at minimum, and information that would give me confidence in working with them.</i></li>
                <li><i>Examples of their work as well as a list of their clients</i></li>
                <li><i>I’d want to see lots of examples because I may not know what I really want, but if I see examples I can say “I want THAT”</i></li>
                <li><i>I’d for sure check references to see how cooperative they are to work with and check their skills</i></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li>Would it be more beneficial to have all of the potential employee’s completed work displayed on one page or have the work organized by type, 
            ‘i.e. web pages vs digital media?</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Definitely by type. I don’t need to wade through digital signage, branding, web development, etc. if I am only interested in one of those, 
                    I will leave the page before doing that.</i></li>
                <li><i>When you are looking for a product to purchase you make decisions quickly based on what you see on the web page.</i></li>
                <li><i>Organize by type, if you’re looking for one kind of service you don’t want to wade through other things</i></li>
                <li><i>Homepages, resumes, etc. need to be clearly organized with large clear tabs so I can get to the information directly and don’t 
                    have to hunt around.</i></li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>How much personal information would you expect to see? Only information about their work or more extensive information about their schooling 
            and how they got into their field?</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Mainly information about their work, I would not want to see details about schooling</i></li>
                <li><i>The only additional information I’d want to see would be broader information about the skills they specialize in</i></li>
                <li><i>Personal information is not necessary</i></li>
                <li><i>If the designer has some AMAZING credentials or went to a special school then I think that’s relevant</i></li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Would you want to see a picture of them?</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Not at all</i></li>
                <li><i>I don’t need a picture, no</i></li>
                <li><i>A picture would make it seem like it’s all about them and not my project</i></li>
                <li><i>It might be nice to see who I’m working with but it’s not necessary</i></li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Would you prefer that the links to their completed project open in new tabs or in the same tab?</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>I would prefer the same tab unless it is a pdf</i></li>
                <li><i>The same tab, otherwise I would end up with a lot of tabs open</i></li>
                <li><i>I would prefer new tabs</i></li>
                <li><i>With a new tab I could toggle back and forth without getting lost down a rabbit hole</i></li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>How often would you, as the potential employer, visit the site?</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Probably 5-7 times, each time I leave I might think of something else to look for</i></li>
                <li><i>Several times, especially if I’m comparing two companies</i></li>
                <li><i>It depends on what I got out of my first visit, the first look would be an overview of services etc. 
                       as I’d probably be looking at multiple sites, and I might eliminate some people at that point</i></li>
                <li><i>3-4 times to compare services between multiple companies and I’d look over the site again during an interview</i></li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reference Sites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This site is an example of poor navigation that will be avoided in my site - there is no fixed navigation bar requiring the user 
                to scroll through the entire page <a href="https://www.hootdesignco.com/services">Hoot Design</a></li>
            <li>The navigation on this site is a good example of what could be done on mine - there is a fixed navigation bar at the top with drop 
                down menus to clearly organize the content <a href="http://mayecreate.com/">Maye Create</a></li>
            <li>The simple use of color on this site is a good reference for what I can do on my site - the color scheme is only 3 colors that compliment 
                each other <a href="http://www.caledonvirtual.com/services/web-design/">Caledon Virtual</a></li>
            <li>This site could be a good reference for displaying skill level with web design, something the interviewed member 
                mentioned <a href="https://ellisbenus.com/">Ellis Benus</a></li>
            <li>This site is a references for how some of the interviewed group would prefer the projects be displayed, opened in new 
                tabs, <a href="http://www.theturninggear.com/">The Turning Gear</a></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Presentation Information</h2>
    <h3>Content Synopsis</h3>
        <p>Taking into consideration the responses to the interview questions and the reference sites, I’ve decided to include the 
            following pages in addition to the Homepage</p>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Work</u> (2 pages)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Websites</u> This page will display examples of completed websites that I’ve built</li>
                    <li><u>Digital Media</u> This page will display completed digital media, primarily images, that I’ve created</li>
                </ul>
            <li><u>Clients</u> This page will list any clients that I have</li>
            <li><u>About</u> This page will give a brief summary of my experience with website and digital media development, including any education 
                or training that is related to my work.</li>
            <li><u>Contact</u> This page will have a contact form that users can fill out as well as other contact information like phone number and social media</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Text Outline</h3>
        <p>Every page on the website will have the same fixed navigation bar to maintain a sense of consistency throughout the site, and so that the user can 
            easily and quickly navigate from one page to the next. The color scheme and layout will also be similar on all pages to keep the design consistent.
            Every page will also have a footer with the update date, my email, and my name as the creator.</p>

                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> Should any of the page become long enough to require a lot of scrolling, a button to take the user back to the top of the page can be added.</p>
    <h2>Media</h2>
        <p>The header will contain an icon that i create in Photoshop CC. There will be an image of me in the About section, and any other images will be 
            thumbnails of works that I’ve completed.</p>
    <h2>Color Scheme and Rationale</h2>
        <p>For the color scheme I want to use colors that are warm and inviting but not hard to look at. The color scheme will be in the orange/brown family. 
            All of the body and text areas will have the same off white color with a slight orange tint, the header will be in the orange family, and all titles 
            will be a darker brown color. Links will either be the standard blue or a brighter orange. The background color is used on this page, and 
            the other colors are sampled below:</p>
        <div class="box header"></div>
        <br>
        <div class="box title"></div>
        <br>
        <div class="box hometitle"></div>
    <br>
    <p>The <a href="https://csb79.github.io/islt_7360/unit4/wireframe.png">wireframe</a> can be viewed as a png.</p>
