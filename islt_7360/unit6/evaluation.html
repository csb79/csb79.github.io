        <h1>Catherine's Portfolio Evaluation Report</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Evaluation Participants</h2>
        <p>Tim Seidel is my father and a retired division director for FEMA. During his time with FEMA he was a part of the interview and hiring process for his department.
            I asked him to evalaute my website as an employer viewing an applicant's portfolio. His evaluation fulfills my use case scenario where I apply to a position, 
            and the employer views my website to assess my background and skills. Tim used a Toshiba Chromebook to view the site, which has no proper operating system - it 
            runs entirely through the Chrome browser. 
        </p>
        <p>Elizabeth Seidel is my sister, and she works as the Commercial Producer for one of her local television stations. Elizabeth works closely with sales team and clients
            on a regular basis, and I asked her to evaluate my site from the perspective of a potential client who is fairly tech savy. She fulfills my use case scenario in which
            a user with a functioning website is looking for a digital media creator. Elizabeth used a Dell laptop running Windows 10 Pro and an Intel Core 5th Generation Processor.
            She viewed the site through the Chrome browser.
        </p>
        <p>Maggie Holley is a family friend who is a Professor at UMKC and is not very knowledgeable about websites and their development. I asked her to evaluate my website
            from the persoective of a user who is need of either web development or digital media services but is not entirely sure what they want. She fulsills a use case 
            scenario in which a potential client is looking for a web developer. She viewed the site on her Mac through the Safari browser.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary of Evaluations</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Score</th>
            </tr>

                <td>3</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
            Everyone thought that the navigation on my site was simple, easy, and logical, and gave those categories a score of 5. Both Tim and Elizabeth commented 
            on how the pages that display my projects (Digital Media and Websites) could have bettwe organization - Tim specifically mentioned that there should be more
            space between the project links, because they currently seem cluttered. Tim and Elizabeth also noted that I failed to include height and width attributes
            on the images.  
        </p>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>
            All three evaluators gave low scores (either 2 or 1) for in depth content. Tim and Maggie both stated that the current level of content would neither require
            nor inspire repeated visits to the site, and Elizabeth said that, should the purpose of the site be achieved with more content, repeated visits would be more 
            likely. Otherwise, the purpose of the site and its content is clear. 
        </p>
        <h3>Credibility</h3>
        <p>
            The credibility category for my site received the lowest scores. Elizabeth mentioned that I should include copyright information for any copywrited materials
            that were used to complete the digital media projects. Tim and Maggie both noted the lack of information about the author, and this would be due to the 'about'
            page not yet being completed. Some grammar mistakes were also noted by all three users. 
        </p>
        <h4>Evaluation Data</h4>
        <a href="e_evaluation.docx">Elizabeth</a>
        <a href="t_evaluation.docx">Tim</a>
        <a href="m_evaluation.docx">Maggie</a>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>Based on the recommendations from the evaluators, there are a couple changes that I will make to the website. First, I will adjust the works pages (digital
            media and websites) so that the content isn't positioned so closely together. This will utilize more space on the page, so that there is less open space, and 
            prevent the content from appearing cluttered. I will also add information to the works pages, providing details about the content so that users have context
            for the projects. This added information will include copyright information for any material that was used in completing the projects.
        </p>
        <p>Second, I need to add height and width attributes to the images that I have on the site, and fix the grammar mistakes made during the initial construction
            of the site. Being more aware of grammatical mistakes will make the site look more profesesional and make me a more concerned and engaged author. Lastly, the about 
            page will of course be added for the final site, and will contain educational and background information to illustrate my credibility. 
        </p>
        <h2>Evaluation Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I found the evaluation process to be an excellent way to find the improvements that could or need to be made to my website that I had not noticed. When working
            on a project, be it a website or digital media, it can be difficult to notice all of its flaws, because the creator spends so much time working on it they can become 
            blind to some of the flaws. An outside perspective helps to find those flaws. My evaluators pointed out a few things that I wasn't worried about or hadn't thought 
            were issues (such as the spacing of the content), and I also learned how difference types of users focus on different aspects of the website.
